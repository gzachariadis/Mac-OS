Tips and Tricks

<br>

1. First things I do once I get a new Mac 

        Change the update check frequency for app store from 7 days to whatever you want
        
            defaults write com.apple.SoftwareUpdate ScheduleFrequency -int [number of days]
            
            I personally like to keep my Mac updated every day so I input 1 
<br>

1. Quick Look

    Select a file --> Press Spacebar = Will preview the file without having to open it (press Spacebar again and you will exit preview)

      Sidenote : Option (alt) + Cmd (command) + Y for immediate full screen and Esc to exit it

      Also you can look into a Zip without Unziping (which is free)

          For this you will need the BetterZip Quick Look plugin which can be found here : (https://macitbetter.com/BetterZip-Quick-Look-Generator/)

<br>

2. Search in Finder

<br>

    When searching for a file you have to use "" (e.g. "Screenshot") for only files containing the given search parameter to show up, because Finder searches   
    thought meta data by default

<br>

3. App Switcher
<br>

    Command + Tab (tab to cycle through)
    Commad + Q (to close from the app switcher)

<br>

4. Hide all Other Windows
<br>

    Option (alt) + Command + H will hide all windows except of your active one.

<br>

5. Copy Browser Link
<br>
    
    Want to copy the link of the webpage you are in? Command + L
  
<br>

6. Force Quit Applications
<br>
    
    Cmd + Alt + Escape

<br>
7. Window Management
<br>
    
    Click just under the window management icons to expand a window to your screen. (It does not fullscreen it so you not locked in)    
 
 
<br>
8. Desktop Icons
<br>
   
   Most people download and use apps like HiddenMe or Other sort of solution to hide unhide their icons. I for example map it into my Streamdeck and previously      into a shorcut of my own.
   
   Hide
   
   defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false

   Unhide
   
   defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true
      
   Be reminded that you need to restart finder with this option for it to take effect (killall Finder) is the way to do that.   
      
<br>
8. Text Manipulation
<br>
      How to select text the propery way
      
        Hold Alt Key ---> cursor turns into cross. Now you can select columns instead of getting the whole thing.
      
      How to Search Words
      
        If you like me you probably forget how words are spelled all the time. Well, Mac got you covered, as long as you remember how the word starts you can             type and press F5 to search for all words matching that starting point.
       
      How to Fix Words
      
        If you want to type something like "jk" or "fuck" and you do a mistake press Ctrl + T and Mac will witch the last two letters for you.
      

<br>
9. Whoopies
<br>

    If you accidentaly closed a window that you needed, most browsers allow the Command + Z  (aka undo) to brind that window back, but that does not work for         other applications. Mac has Cmd + Shift + T which is universal.
    
<br>
10. Duplicate or else known fast copy and paste
<br>    


    Let's say you have two folders open and you want to create a duplicate of one file (copy) into another folder or in your desktop. All you have to do is hold     option and drag the file to its new destination. That will diplicate the file where you want it to. 
    


### Apps

Some pesonal notes :

1. I use AppStore as my primary method of searching and buying applications I plan to install on my computer and I suggest you do too.
2. Having said that, I personally also avoid apps that require a subscription except in rare cases.q
3. Also, although I pay for all my apps not only to support developers but to ensure in my part these apps continue to provide updates and compatibbility so I don't have to switch or search for new ones to replace them arguably costing me more money and time long term.
